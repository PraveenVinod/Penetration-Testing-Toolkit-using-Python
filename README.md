## 📌 Overview
The **Penetration Testing Toolkit** is a beginner-friendly Python tool that provides essential modules for conducting basic penetration tests and network security assessments. It helps perform:

- 🟡 **Port Scanning**
- 🔴 **Banner Grabbing**
- 🟣 **Brute Force Attack Simulation**

It is designed for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and ethical hackers to learn and practice penetration testing techniques.

---

## Key Features

- ✅ Scan for **open TCP ports** on a target IP/domain
- ✅ Perform **banner grabbing** to identify running services on open ports
- ✅ Simulate **brute force** attacks on login forms using a dictionary list
- ✅ Generate **HTML reports** of scan results
- ✅ Simple **terminal-based interface**

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

✅ Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x installed

Required Python modules:
- `socket` (standard library)
- `requests`
- `time` (standard library)
- `os` (standard library)

To install required modules, run:
`pip install requests`

## ⚙️ Usage
**Step 1: Run the Program**

**Step 2: Choose an Option**

- Option 1: Port Scanner
Scans the target IP/domain for open TCP ports from a predefined list.

- Option 2: Banner Grabber
Retrieves and displays banners from open ports to identify services and versions.

- Option 3: Brute Forcer
Simulates a dictionary-based brute force attack on login forms to guess passwords.

- Option 4: Exit
